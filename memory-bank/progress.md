# Progress

## What Works

- The basic Elixir/Phoenix project structure is in place.
- Core memory bank files have been initialized and updated with project details.
- Basic User Authentication & Account Management setup using `phx.gen.auth` is complete, including user registration, email confirmation (via dev mailbox), and login/logout.

## What's Left to Build

- Full integration of the authentication system into the application flow (e.g., protected routes).
- Account Grouping/Invite System.
- Chat Room Creation & Management.
- Real-time Text Chat using Phoenix Channels.
- Guest Access mechanism.
- AI Participant Integration (public and private interaction).
- PWA Functionality (manifest file, service worker).

## Current Status

The foundational authentication system is set up and verified. The project is ready to integrate authentication into the application flow and begin implementing other core MVP features.

## Known Issues

- No known issues at this stage.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial decision to use Elixir/Phoenix with LiveView and Channels for real-time PWA development.
- Decision to integrate with a third-party LLM API for AI capabilities.
- Decision to use `mix phx.gen.auth` for the core authentication system due to its comprehensive features.
