# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Setting up the basic user authentication system and basic chat room management for the AI-Assisted Group Chat PWA using Elixir/Phoenix.

## Recent Changes

- Initial core memory bank files created and updated.
- Ran `mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users --binary-id` to generate authentication code, fetched dependencies, created the database, and ran migrations. User manually verified registration and login.
- Ran `mix phx.gen.live Chat ChatRoom chat_rooms name:string:unique user_id:references:users` to generate chat room management code.
- Corrected the `CreateChatRooms` migration to use `type: :uuid` for the `user_id` reference.
- Ran `mix ecto.migrate` to create the `chat_rooms` table.
- Added chat room management routes to the authenticated scope in `lib/ai_group_chat_web/router.ex`.
- User manually verified that the chat room index page is accessible to a logged-in user.

## Next Steps

- Implement the real-time text chat functionality within chat rooms using Phoenix Channels.
- Begin implementing the Account Grouping/Invite System.
- Continue implementing other core features as outlined in the MVP section of the project brief.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Utilizing Elixir/Phoenix with LiveView for the backend and frontend.
- Using Phoenix Channels for real-time communication.
- Integrating with a third-party LLM API for AI functionality.
- Designing for PWA capabilities from the outset.
- Using `phx.gen.auth` for the core authentication system.
- Using `phx.gen.live` for basic chat room management.
- Using UUIDs for user and chat room IDs.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Following Elixir/Phoenix conventions and best practices.
- Prioritizing real-time performance and scalability.
- Ensuring routes requiring authentication are properly protected.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project requires a robust real-time communication layer.
- AI integration needs careful consideration for both public and private interactions.
- PWA features will enhance user accessibility and experience.
- `phx.gen.auth` and `phx.gen.live` are effective generators for scaffolding core features.
- Need to be mindful of data type consistency (e.g., UUIDs) when generating code that references existing schemas.
