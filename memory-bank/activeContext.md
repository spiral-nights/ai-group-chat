# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

Setting up and verifying the basic user authentication system for the AI-Assisted Group Chat PWA using Elixir/Phoenix's `phx.gen.auth`.

## Recent Changes

- Initial core memory bank files created and updated.
- Ran `mix phx.gen.auth Accounts User users --binary-id` to generate authentication code.
- Ran `mix deps.get` to fetch new dependencies.
- Ran `mix ecto.create` to create the development database.
- Ran `mix ecto.migrate` to create the necessary authentication tables (`users`, `users_tokens`).
- User manually verified that the generated registration and login pages are functional and confirmed account creation via the development mailbox.

## Next Steps

- Integrate the generated authentication components into the main application flow (e.g., restricting access to certain pages).
- Begin implementing the Account Grouping/Invite System.
- Continue implementing other core features as outlined in the MVP section of the project brief.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Utilizing Elixir/Phoenix with LiveView for the backend and frontend.
- Using Phoenix Channels for real-time communication.
- Integrating with a third-party LLM API for AI functionality.
- Designing for PWA capabilities from the outset.
- Using `phx.gen.auth` for the core authentication system.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Following Elixir/Phoenix conventions and best practices.
- Prioritizing real-time performance and scalability.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project requires a robust real-time communication layer.
- AI integration needs careful consideration for both public and private interactions.
- PWA features will enhance user accessibility and experience.
- `phx.gen.auth` provides a solid foundation for the authentication system.
